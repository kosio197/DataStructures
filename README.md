**Course description:**<br />

* Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity
  * Abstract data structures (ATD) and implementations
  * Algorithm complexity
  * The "big o" notation – O(g(x))
  * The "big theta" notation – Θ(g(x))
  * Analyzing algorithms complexity
* Linear Data Structures – Lists
  * Linear data structures – lists, stacks, queues
  * Lists: linked list and array-based implementations
* Linear Data Structures – Stacks and Queues
  * Queues: linked and circular array-based implementations
  * Stacks: linked and array-based implementations
* Trees and Tree-Like Structures
  * Trees and implementations
  * Binary tree traversals: preorder, in-order, post order
* Tree Traversal Algorithms – BFS and DFS
  * Depth-first-search (DFS)
  * Breadth-first search (BFS)
* Dictionaries and Hash Tables
  * Dictionary / map / associative array ADT
  * Hashing and hash functions
  * Hash-tables and collision resolutions
* Collection Data Structures and Libraries
  * Collection data structures: lists, dictionaries, ordered dictionaries, multi-dictionaries, ordered multi-dictionaries, sets, ordered sets, bags, ordered bags
  * Wintellect Power Collections and C5 Collections data structure libraries
* Advanced Tree Structures
  * Priority queue, heap, rope, trie, suffix tree, interval tree, index tree
  * BSP-trees (binary space partitioning)
  * K-d trees (k-dimensional trees)
* Data Structure Efficiency
  * Comparison of data structures and their computational complexity
  * Compare efficiency of arrays, lists, trees, hash-tables, sets, bags, etc.
